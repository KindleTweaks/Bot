Winterbreak2 is a simple jailbreak for blacklisted Kindles.
It works on `5.16.3` and below, and on `5.16.5`.

It is also frequently used when Winterbreak/Mesquito fails.

Usage Steps:

1. Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/KindleModding/Winterbreak2/releases).
2. Unzip the release on your computer.
3. Copy all of the contents to your Kindle's root.
4. Open the browser and go to `https://winterbreak2.now.sh/`.
5. Press the Jailbreak button.
6. A dialog will open, and jailbreaking will commence.
7. Follow the Hotfix steps [here](https://kindlemodding.org/jailbreaking/post-jailbreak/setting-up-a-hotfix/).

Troubleshooting:

1. A dialog opens saying downloading `Winterbreak2.mobi`, but nothing happens.
    - You copied the files incorrectly. Do *not* clone the repo, ensure the files are in root and not nested.
2. A dialog opens, saying "unsupported file type"
    - You are not on a supported firmware. Try normal WinterBreak or AdBreak.
