Contemplating jailbreaking a Kindle? Here are the main pros & cons!

**Pros**:

- Access to an active community of `40,000+` members
- Get KOReader, an alternative, open-source, customizable reading experience.
- Download Anki & flashcard apps for study purposes.
- Use Bluetooth page turners, or listen to music over a Bluetooth speaker.
- Write on your Kindle with a physical keyboard, taking advantage of its anti-glare e-ink screen.
- Play games such as Wordle, detach yourself from your phone.
- Learn how to make your own homebrew and contribute back to the community.
- Not a ROM, just a jailbreak: jailbreaking itself changes nothing, all system features will remain, but you can also get other apps/modifications on top of the system - not as a replacement.
- Disabling adverts for free, not paying $20
- Getting customizable screensavers
- Patching the browser, VNC, SSH, "Custom OSes" and more...

**Cons**:

- Purchasing a Kindle with the sole intent to jailbreak may backfire as there's a decent possibility it could arrive on an unjailbreakable firmware.
- Certain tweaks could cause lag/performance issues, but this isn't because of jailbreak itself.
- Everyone will know you as "that weird guy who jailbroke his Kindle and plays doom on it" (did I mention it plays doom?)
