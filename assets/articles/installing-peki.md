If MRPI isn't installing KUAL properly, you may try PEKI.
PEKI is a safe way to install KUAL without MRPI.

**Before you begin: Ensure you are on hotfix `2.3.2` or `2.3.7`+.**

Installation Steps:

1. Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/KindleTweaks/PEKI/releases).
2. Unzip the release on your computer.
3. Copy the `.sh` and `.jar` file within to the `documents` folder on your Kindle.
4. Tap the booklet once, it will install the first time so may take a bit longer.
5. You should see some text saying "Installing KUAL" on your screen.
6. KUAL will launch!

**Troubleshooting:**

1. Use a supported Hotfix version, as notated above.
2. Ensure you are on a WinterBroken or AdBroken device.
3. Ensure you are on firmware `5.12.2.2` or above.
4. Wait at least 5 minutes for the booklet to appear.
