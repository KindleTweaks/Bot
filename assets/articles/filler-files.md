Prior to jailbreaking, it is wise to fill up your Kindle's storage with junk files in order to prevent automatic updates throughout the process.

Usage Steps:

1. Turn on aeroplane mode on your Kindle.
2. Connect your Kindle to your computer.
3. Delete any files ending with `tmp.bin.partial` or something along those lines, if they exist.
4. Download the filler files matching your Kindle's storage capacity from [here](https://github.com/bastianmarin/Kindle-Filler-Disk/tree/main/MTP/).
5. Extract the zip file on your computer.
6. Move as many junk files to the Kindle as needed, until there is `20-90MB` of free space left.
7. Done! Proceed with [jailbreak](https://kindlemodding.org/).

You may delete the update files after you rename OTAs successfully.

NOTE: This article does not provide the filler-script method because of MTP support.
