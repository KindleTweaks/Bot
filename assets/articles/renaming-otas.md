Renaming OTA Binaries is an essential part of the jailbreaking process, to ensure your jailbreak remains.
In order to do this, you may use a KUAL extension.

**Ensure you have KUAL installed prior to proceeding!**

Installation Steps (Firmwares `5.11`+):

Stay on the lookout for any `.bin` or `.tmp.partial.bin` files during this process, so you don't accidentally update.

1. Download the latest release from [here](https://kindlemodding.org/jailbreaking/post-jailbreak/renameotabin.zip).
2. Plug your Kindle into your Computer.
3. Unzip and copy the release into the `extensions` folder on your Kindle.
    - The `renameotabin` folder containing usable files may be nested inside another folder! Copy over the inner-most one.
4. Unplug your Kindle
5. Open `KUAL` > Select `Rename OTA Binaries` > Select `Rename` > Your Kindle will reboot.
6. You're Done! 
7. Extra: Want to reset/downgrade/update your Kindle? You'll need to restore OTA binaries. Click `KUAL` > Select `Rename OTA Binaries` > Select `Restore`.
 
Resetted/updated/downgraded without restoring? Follow the guide [here](https://kindlemodding.org/jailbreaking/recovering-from-a-reset.html).

Installation Steps (Prior to firmware `5.11`):

1. Plug your Kindle into your Computer.
2. Navigate to the root directory and create a folder called `update.bin.tmp.partial`.
3. Done! OTA updates are now disabled.
4. Extra: To restore OTA updates, simply delete the folder.
